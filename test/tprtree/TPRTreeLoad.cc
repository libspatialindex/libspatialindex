					// storage (e.g. a hash table or a database table, etc.).
					// Storing the data in the index is convinient and in case a clustered storage manager is
					// provided (one that stores any node in consecutive pages) performance will improve substantially,
					// since disk accesses will be mostly sequential. On the other hand, the index will need to
					// manipulate the data, resulting in larger overhead. If you use a main memory storage manager,
					// storing the data externally is highly recommended (clustering has no effect).
					// A clustered storage manager is NOT provided yet.
					// Also you will have to take care of converting you data to and from binary format, since only
					// array of bytes can be inserted in the index (see RTree::Node::load and RTree::Node::store for
					// an example of how to do that).
